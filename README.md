# atom-zenburn-syntax

I made this because one of the best theme of vim does not exist for Atom. The ones that exist are incomplete or are not based on original.

This new one looks very similar to the original https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn. Atom's syntax lexer dosn't do a good job, so dosn't expect an equal theme.

## Install

- Enter theme's root folder with terminal
- Do `apm link`
- Set yout theme in Atom configuration
